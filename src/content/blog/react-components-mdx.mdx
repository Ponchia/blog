This blog post demonstrates how to use React components within MDX files in Astro.

## What is MDX?

MDX combines the power of Markdown with JSX, allowing you to import and use React components directly in your content.

## Example Component

Here's a simple counter component built with React:

import { useState } from 'react';

export const Counter = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div style={{ padding: '1rem', background: '#f4f4f4', borderRadius: '0.5rem', marginBottom: '1rem' }}>
      <p>Current count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count - 1)}>Decrement</button>
    </div>
  );
};

<Counter client:visible />

## How It Works

1. Create your React component (can be inline or imported)
2. Add the appropriate client directive (like `client:visible`)
3. Use the component in your MDX content

## Benefits of Using React in MDX

- Interactive elements in otherwise static content
- Reusable components across multiple content pages
- Full access to React's ecosystem and features

This approach gives you the best of both worlds - the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React when needed.
